CycleSentry Data Movement

RFID -> Server :

What does the RFID module do?
- report tags seen (ie. phone tags, bike tags)
- ie rackID, {timestamp?, tagID: rising/falling bit}


Server <-> App :

What does the server do?
- SENDS info to app (see info under app DISPLAY)
	- sometimes just basic
	- sometimes calculated (calc every send, or calc & store & update?)

- THINK
	- what bikes are signed in where
	- that bike is being stolen! (notify app)

- ADMIN	(password protected area)
	- register a new user
	- see list of users
	- update/add tags for users
	
- SHOW a pretty front end with tabs
	- info on the project
	- analytics
	- admin (see above)
	
	
MONGO:
- users: {UID, name, phoneNo, address, role, password}
- tags: {UID, TagID, type = bike, nickname, currState: {RackID or -1(not signed in anywhere) or MIA, timestamp}} -> timestamp of the CHANGE
		{UID, TagID, type = keychain, nickname, currState: {rackID, timestamp}}  -> timestamp when seen

- racks: {RackID, name, ??}

- RFIDinfo: {connor sends us} -> parse 
	- ie. {timestamp, keychainID, 
	- {how we want to store that}

- historical info - analytics and info to user
- how many days in a row did you bike to campus??


What does the app do?
- DISPLAYS info FROM server   (a whole bunch of json strings)
	- where/if signed in
	- push notifications for stolen bike
	- ???
	- commonly used racks
	- ???
	
	** TODO: make list of app displays and api calls for those
	
- SENDS info TO server		(also json strings)	
	- signing in/signing out
	- notification responses: that was me/that was a theft
	- ???
	- "my bike was stolen"
	
- OTHER:
	- allows users to contact campus security
	- ???
