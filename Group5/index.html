                     Motivation for the Project
                </h4>
                <p>
                    High bike theft rate in Kingston deters cycling [1] – Queen’s bike rack placement could be improved with data on usage – Well-integrated Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) systems can improve daily life Objectives of the System – Discourage bike theft on Queen’s University – Collect useful data on bike rack usage – Explore the feasibility of RFID bike monitoring Challenges – Supervisor change resulted in new budget, so only one RFID reader could be purchased – Purchased RFID reader: – Range is impractically small (~5 cm) – Only detects one tag at a time Project Overview Three main sub-systems – Hardware: Xbees and Arduinos – Server: database and control logic – Android App
                </p>
                <h4>
                CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS 
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Feasibility – Technologically feasible to implement – Would require more expensive RFID readers – Costs could be mitigated by: – Technology maturation – Bulk purchasing – Custom/non-hobbyist caliber parts Future Work – Explore systems based on other technologies – Possibilities: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi – Downside: likely need batteries on bikes Legal and Ethical Concerns – Privacy: tracking bike rack arrival/departure times – Liability: reckless riding injuries, vigilantism [2] [3] – Illegal Uses: thieves using bike rack usage data Possible Integrations – Video camera that saves footage of bike rack vicinity for the time period of detected thefts – Theft data/notifications sent to Campus Security – Kingston Police using RFID scanners to read the tags of recovered stolen bikes</p>
